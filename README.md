# IDGASFAWHTTC-License
Repository for the I Don't Give A Single Fuck About What Happens To This Code License. A verbose adaptation of the Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License (WTFPL).

## Why?
WTFPL is great, but it's too concise and vague. IDGASFAWHTTC attempts to remedy this situation by providing well-documented definitions for potentially ambiguous terms.

DISCLAIMER: This license was created by someone who is ABSOLUTELY NOT a lawyer. IDGASFAWHTTC gives no claim to its legal enforcability. Do not use this license if you are uncomfortable with that fact. (In layman's terms: fuck off, I'm not your lawyer.)

## How do I apply it to my project?
Copy the LICENSE file to the root directory of your project.

Add the following notice to all source files to which you wish to apply this license:

```
Copyright {year} {name}

Licensed to any and all persons under the I Don't Give A Single Fuck About
What Happens To This Code License, Version 1. Hopefully, whoever distributed
this code to you included a LICENSE text file in the root directory of this
project, containing the full terms and conditions of this License. If not, you
can obtain a copy of any Version of the License at:
https://www.archandle.net/IDGASFAWHTTC-License
```

Replace `{year}` and `{name}` (including the curly brackets) with the current year and your name/pseudonym, respectively.

## What's up with the copyright declaration boilerplates, including the one in the license? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose?
The declaration of copyright in YOUR source code simply ensures that a definite licensor is established when code declares that it is licensed under the I Don't Give A Single Fuck About What Happens To This Code License. If you apply this license to your code, you can omit the copyright declaration in your source code if you want to, I don't give a single fuck about what happens to your code.

However, the copyright declaration on THIS license and the single restriction that the License cannot be distributed under the same name must remain. Before your panties get bunched about freedom, I do this (similarly to WTFPL) simply to avoid the situation where someone creates a derivative IDGASFAWHTTC License under the same name, which may cause confusion between which IDGASFAWHTTC license applies (especially bad if the terms are changed significantly). For the sake of everyone's sanity, if you derive this license, just give it a new name, and at that point I don't give a single fuck about what happens to your license.

## This license fucking sucks!
Good thing it's only Version 1! Feel free to suggest amendments and I'll compile all the ones that fit appropriately for V2. Remember: be VERBOSE. Make it well-known, without ambiguity, that you don't give a single fuck about what happens to this code.

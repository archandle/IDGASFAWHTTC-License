# IDGASFAWHTTC-License
Repository for the I Don't Give A Single Fuck About What Happens To This Code License. A verbose adaptation of the Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License (WTFPL).

## Why?
WTFPL is great, but it's too concise and vague. IDGASFAWHTTC attempts to remedy this situation by providing well-documented definitions for potentially ambiguous terms.

DISCLAIMER: This license was created by someone who is ABSOLUTELY NOT a lawyer. IDGASFAWHTTC gives no claim to its legal enforcability. Do not use this license if you are uncomfortable with that fact. (In layman's terms: fuck off, I'm not your lawyer.)

## How do I apply it to my project?
Copy the LICENSE file to the root directory of your project.

Add the following notice to all source files to which you wish to apply this license:

```
Copyright {year} {name}

Licensed to any and all persons under the I Don't Give A Single Fuck About
What Happens To This Code License, Version 1. Hopefully, whoever distributed
this code to you included a LICENSE text file in the root directory of this
project, containing the full terms and conditions of this License. If not, you
can obtain a copy of any Version of the License at:
https://www.archandle.net/IDGASFAWHTTC-License
```

Replace `{year}` and `{name}` (including the curly brackets) with the current year and your name/pseudonym, respectively.
